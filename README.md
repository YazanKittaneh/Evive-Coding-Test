## ðŸ“‹ Description

Goal of the project is to create an object-oriented solution to a 'menu ordering system'. 
This solution includes tests, and doesn't require any dependencies. The user can input orders in the following format:

<i>Menu x,x,x,x</i> format

Example: Lunch 1,2,3

## ðŸ“– Getting It To Run


The easiest way to get this program running would be to install IntelliJ IDEA which comes with its own Kotlin compiler. <br>

[Install IntelliJ IDEA here][idea] <br>
[Learn how to run Kotlin File here][howto]<br>
[Run the code in-browser here (note: this method will not run the tests)][browser]<br>

## ðŸš€ Wanted Improvements

There are various improvements to the program that were left off because of time constraints. 
This includes:
- Format output to reflect the original prompt (Out: [Sandwich, Chips, Soda] -> Out: Sandwich, Chips, Soda)
- Turn all strings into organized ENUMS
- Lower and upper bound unit testing for all functions
- Turn menu into it's own object
- Add a sassy mode
